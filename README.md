# Lore Lens

Lore Lens is a knowledge and lore management platform for books, games,
and future media like films and research papers.

## Problem Statement

When reading books or playing narrative-heavy games, key events, characters, and relationships are easy to forget or misremember. Existing tools don’t provide a structured, searchable way to capture and revisit this knowledge over time.

## MVP Scope
- User Authentication

## Tech Stack
